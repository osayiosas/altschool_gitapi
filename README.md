### Requirements 

for this project you need a understanding of javascrip and react.js with understanding of css and any of the css frameworks

written in React (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces). It's primarily responsible for importing necessary modules and components that will be used in the rest of the file.

### Recommended modules 

`import React from "react";` imports the React library, which is the fundamental library for building components in a React application.

`import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";` imports the ReactDOM library, which provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a React application.

`import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "react-query";` imports `QueryClient` and `QueryClientProvider` from `react-query`. React Query is a library for fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in React applications.

`import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "react-query/devtools";` imports the development tools for React Query. This is useful for debugging your application's queries.

`import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Route } from "react-router-dom";` imports `createBrowserRouter`, `RouterProvider`, and `Route` from `react-router-dom`. React Router is a library that allows you to handle routing in your React application.

`import { Root, ErrorPage, RepoList, SingleRepo, ErrorBoundary, ErrorBoundaryTest } from "./routes";` imports several components from a local file named `routes`. These components are likely to be used as different pages or parts of pages in your application.

`import { HelmetProvider } from "react-helmet-async";` imports `HelmetProvider` from `react-helmet-async`, a library that manages changes to the document head, allowing you to dynamically set the HTML metadata in a React application.

`import "./index.css";` imports a CSS file, which likely contains global styles for your application.
